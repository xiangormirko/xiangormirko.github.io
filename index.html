        	Biography:

            After one year in a large company as a Agile Project Manager, I am ready to devour more knowledge and hone my skills. I want to assimilate as much as possible from my Startup Institute experience and position myself to solve problems and needs, with customer and data driven solutions. 

I lived extensively in 3 continents, I am excited to see where my next chapter will bring me. I want to join or create something meaningful that will work better than coffee to get me awake in the morning.

           What do you consider your major assets?

           Something that I found always useful is my cheerfulness. People describe me as someone with a tremendous attitude to learn, share, and  do.  I always believe that is up to me if I want to tackle the day ahead of me with a big smile or being all gloomy. Of course I choose the first option. 

So to any team that I will join, you have my utmost commitment to do my best and bring my boundless enthusiasm!

        	What can't you live without?

        	Coffee, second coffee, after lunch coffee, and apr√®s-dinner digestive coffee. 

Fresh air, I need a good dose of fresh air a few times a day to feel more alive. 

Sleep... I know that there is a tacit consent that ideal start up people are invincible action machines that don't need sleep. I love sleeping, but I am more than willing to put the extra hours and get things done.
