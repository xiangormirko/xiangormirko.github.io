        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>
            After one year in a large company as a Agile Project Manager, I am ready to devour more knowledge and hone my skills. I want to assimilate as much as possible from my Startup Institute experience and position myself to solve problems and needs, with customer and data driven solutions. 

I lived extensively in 3 continents, I am excited to see where my next chapter will bring me. I want to join or create something meaningful that will work better than coffee to get me awake in the morning. 

        </p>
        <h2>What do you consider your major assets?</h2>
        <p>
           Something that I found always useful is my cheerfulness. People describe me as someone with a tremendous attitude to learn, share, and  do.  I always believe that is up to me if I want to tackle the day ahead of me with a big smile or being all gloomy. Of course I choose the first option. 

So to any team that I will join, you have my utmost commitment to do my best and bring my boundless enthusiasm!
        </p>
        <h2>What can't you live without?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-family:Futura">Coffee, second coffee, after lunch coffee, and apres-dinner digestive coffee. </li>
                    <li style="font-family:Futura">Fresh air, I need a good dose of fresh air a few times a day to feel more alive. </li>
                    <li style="font-family:Futura">Sleep... I know that there is a tacit consent that ideal start up people are invincible action machines that don't need sleep. I love sleeping, but I am more than willing to put the extra hours and get things done.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
